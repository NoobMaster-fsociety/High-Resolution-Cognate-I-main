# HIGH RESOLUTION Inventory System

This website was created for academic purposes, and I used ReactJS Framework and Material UI for the frontend, PHP for the API, and MySQL for the database. I also used Node Express and NPM packages such as nodemailer to send emails.

## Note:
this website was publish via Github free domain but for the process such as login and updating use localhost
